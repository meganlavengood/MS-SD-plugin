## Purpose

Adds lyrics below notes that correspond to scale-degree numbers in major or minor. Uses SMuFL glyphs to properly display scale degrees as Arabic numerals with carats/circumflex. Raised/lowered scale degrees are shown with arrows.

**Requires that you use Bravura font for Lyrics text style in order to display properly.**

## Installation instructions

1. Unpack the zip file.
2. Move the **scale-degree-numbers** folder to MuseScoreâ€™s plugins folder. This is configurable at **Preferences > General > Folders**. The default directories are:
    - Windows: C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\MuseScore4\Plugins
    - nmacOS: ~/Documents/MuseScore4/Plugins
    - Linux: ~/Documents/MuseScore4/Plugins
3. In MuseScore, click **Plugins > Manage plugins** and enable both plugins (major and minor).

To update to a new version, simply replace the **scale-degree-numbers** folder with the new one (you may need to restart Musescore).

## Use

1. **Ensure that your Lyrics text type has its font set to Bravura.** Other fonts may not properly display the scale-degree glyphs.
2. Click **Plugins > Scale degree numbers ([major or minor])**
